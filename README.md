VERSION: 1.0<br />

## Content of the repository
1. CodeBook.rmd R markdwon file describing the sun_analisys.R file.
2. "data" folder a unziped version of the https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip data file from the project http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
2. Readm.md file with the description of the project.
3. recordsStep5.txt the tidy data result of the project.
4. run_analysis.R file with the code of the project. 

## Objective
Take the dataq from the http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones project an tidy the data using a R script, finally creta a summarise dataset and store this in a txt File.


# Process to tidy the dataset
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
